# Mini Learning Project 1

In this mini learning project, we will implement a class hierarchy for dense matrices, matrix-vector products, matrix-matrix products, and vector norms. Additionally, we will define a class hierarchy for sparse matrices and their matrix-vector product. We will then explore two types of linear solvers: direct solver (Gaussian Elimination) and iterative solver (Conjugate Gradient linear solver). Finally, we will examine the computational complexity of these solvers.

## Dense Matrix Class Hierarchy

We will define the following classes for the dense matrix class hierarchy:

1. `Matrix`: The base class representing a generic dense matrix with basic functionalities.
2. `DenseMatrix`: A derived class from `Matrix` representing dense matrices.
3. `VectorNorm`: A class to calculate the norm of a vector.

## Sparse Matrix Class Hierarchy

We will define the following classes for the sparse matrix class hierarchy:

1. `SparseMatrix`: A class representing a generic sparse matrix with functionalities to access and modify elements efficiently.

## Linear Solvers

We will define the following classes for the linear solver hierarchy:

1. `GaussianEliminationSolver`: A class implementing the direct solver using Gaussian Elimination for solving linear equations.
2. `ConjugateGradientSolver`: A class implementing the iterative solver using the Conjugate Gradient method for solving linear equations.

## Computational Complexity

We will analyze the computational complexity of both direct and iterative solvers to understand their efficiency in solving linear equations.

# Mini Learning Project 2

In this mini learning project, we will implement a 1D Finite Element Method (FEM) solver for linear equations. The solver will be used to solve the heat equation. We will define the following classes:

## Element Class

The `Element` class will represent the basis functions for each element in the 1D domain. It will provide functionality to evaluate basis functions and their derivatives.

## Grid Class

The `Grid` class will manage the global domain and discretization. It will divide the domain into elements and store them.

## Equation Class

The `Equation` class will construct the local matrix and assemble it into the global matrix. It will also assemble the local right-hand side vector and the global right-hand side vector.

## Solver Class

The `Solver` class will solve the linear system using the assembled global matrix and right-hand side vector. It will implement a solver, such as the Conjugate Gradient method.

## Solving Heat Equation

We will use the implemented 1D FEM solver to solve the heat equation and observe its behavior with different discretizations.

## Convergence and Computational Complexity

We will study the convergence behavior of the FEM solver by comparing the numerical solution with the exact solution for a simplified case. Additionally, we will analyze the computational complexity of the FEM solver to understand its efficiency and scalability.

Both mini learning projects will provide valuable insights into fundamental linear algebra concepts, numerical methods, and computational complexity analysis.
